Welcome to Djedi CMS
====================

Djedi CMS is a lightweight but yet powerful Django content management system with plugins, inline editing and performance in mind.

It differs from other CMS's in a control manner. Your urls, views and templates stays intact and remains Django standard.
You will not loose control of your urls or get forced to hook your logic and views backward-*ish* behind the CMS.
